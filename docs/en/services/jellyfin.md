# Jellyfin

Jellyfin is a personal media streaming service. It is entirely open-source and free, unlike Plex.

I use it to have easy access to videos on my file server from any device.

It also offers the ability to play downloaded music, but in my case, I donâ€™t use this feature as I prefer to listen to my collection with client-side players like [MPD](https://www.musicpd.org/).

It is currently installed on a VM in the hypervisor server, with the *media* datasets mounted as shares.

No special configuration is required for basic use; just install it and add the desired paths from the Web interface.
