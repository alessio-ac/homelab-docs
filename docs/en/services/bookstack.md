# Bookstack

Bookstack is a platform for organizing and storing information.

It uses Markdown for document creation and offers a simple interface for navigating information.

It is currently installed on an LXC container using the image provided by TurnKey, which is available by default on Proxmox.

It was mainly used during the last year of school to study for the exams.
